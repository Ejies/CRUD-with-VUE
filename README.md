We're going to create a small application with Vue. The app will be a simple employee database:

- Set up Vue
- Work with data, methods, conditional statements, and events in Vue
- Create, update, view, and delete users (employees) from the system
- Make API calls for each of the above actions
- Use tables, forms, and form validation
```
